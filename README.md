# Hi, I'm Elisheba Anderson 👋
Principal AI Automation Engineer | Senior Software Engineer

I build cloud-native distributed systems, retrieval pipelines, and LLM-powered applications. I specialize in serverless AI platforms, high-throughput APIs, and productionizing LLM workloads end to end—from data pipelines and evals to observability and cost control.

## 💻 Core Stack
- **AI/ML:** Bedrock, Embeddings, RAG, Vector DBs (pgvector, OpenSearch/FAISS), CrewAI, MCP servers
- **Cloud/Infra:** AWS, Cloudflare Workers, Kubernetes, Terraform
- **Backend:** Java (Spring Boot), Python, REST/gRPC, Kafka, JUnit/Maven
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript/JavaScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL/MySQL, NoSQL, OpenSearch,  pgVector
- **Tooling:** GitHub/Bitbucket, Agile, CI/CD
